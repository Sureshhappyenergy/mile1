My first professional website -  mile1fitness.com
This is my first ever professional website that I am building. It is for a family friend, so it's FREE. The business is a fitness center name mile1. the website is www.mile1.com
I am doing it in studiopress with Aspire Pro theme. I tried to build it fro scratch and it was fun doing it but it was taking a long time, that's why I switched to studiopress. I also wanted to learn Genesis.
I am learning from youtube videos ( WordPress 101 by Alessandro Castellani), Skillcrush and treehouse.
Please do let me know if I am missing anything.
Thank you for reading me.
